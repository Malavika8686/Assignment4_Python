File Handling in Python
This repository contains two Python scripts demonstrating file handling operations:

Task 1: Reading a file and handling errors
Task 2: Writing, appending, and reading data from a file

Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
File: Task_2(4).py
